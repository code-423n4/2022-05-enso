"Submissions can only be made in the second week of the contest"
Does it mean if I found something, I should wait 7 days to submit it?

Sure will fix the readme redirect, however they are in the repo so shouldn’t stop you from digging into the contracts.  Also we recommend joining the discord link above for quicker response times.

Oh okay found it, it was in other folder

Letting the other wardens know that Enso removed the need for spotPrice() in Adapters but forgot to update the docs. They will be following up if they forgot to update any more changes

hi5 (2) thankyou 

[05/07/2022 18:11] Connor | Enso#0001
Thanks for letting the other wardens know.  We will review the docs if there are any other anomalies, in the meanwhile the contracts should be the source of truth.

When running the tests, I am getting "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'address')
      at Context.<anonymous> (test\aave-adapter.ts:454:69)" error , am I missing any additional setup?

`for (int256 i = int256(data.adapters.length-1); i >= 0; i--) { //this doesn't work with uint256?? wtf solidity`  😂

Any reason for that not working? (uint)


[05/18/2022 17:42] 0xsorrynotsorry
I haven't tried yet but comments are cool 🙂

[05/18/2022 18:44] czar102
It doesn't work with `uint256` because it can't be negative, so `i >= 0` would always pass. Before Solidity 0.8.x it would create an infinite loop, after it will revert because decrementing 0 will cause an underflow...

yeah, that's a tautology already. 👍
